1. make sure you extract the package under your Kaltura's server 'plugins' folder.
for example:
/opt/kaltura/app/plugins/sharepoint_extension

2. as root, run:
/path/to/php install.php

3. add the plugin to the default plugins loaded in your environment.
you should do this in the following file:
	{PATH TO YOUR KALTURA SERVER}/app/alpha/config/kConfLocal.php
in that file, find:
	self::$map['default_plugins']
at the end of this section, add another line:
	self::$map['default_plugins'][] = "KalturaSharepointExtensionPlugin";

4. clear server cache, using:
/path/to/php {PATH TO YOUR KALTURA SERVER}/app/scripts/clear_cache.php
